- **test_basic_transalation**: 
  This test verifies the basic translation functionality. It takes the input "how are you?" and checks if the translated text is "Jak się masz?".

- **test_wrong_input**: 
  This test checks the behavior of the translator when the input is not a valid string (in this case, an integer). It ensures that the translator doesn't return a predefined status code (200) in such cases.

- **test_long_text**: 
  This test checks the behavior of the translator when given a long text. It expects the translation process to be terminated due to the length of the text, and it checks if the finish reason is set to "length".

- **test_empty_text**: 
  This test checks the behavior of the translator when an empty string is given as input. It verifies if the translated text is also an empty string.

- **test_phonetic**: 
  This test checks if the translator can correctly handle phonetically similar inputs. It expects the translated text of "Ho ar yoy" to be "Jak się masz?".

- **test_proper_name**: 
  This test specifically deals with proper names. It takes "Wroclaw" as input and expects the translation to be "Wrocław".

- **test_nordish**: 
  This test checks the translation of a phrase with a Nordic language influence. It expects "Hvor er Opera" to be translated to "Gdzie jest Opera."
