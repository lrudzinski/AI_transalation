Enter BERTRAM, the COUNTESS of Rousillon, HELENA, and Lafeu, all in black

Countess. In delivering my son from me, I bury a second husband.
Bertram. And I in going, madam, weep o'er my father's death
anew: but I must attend his majesty's command, to5
whom I am now in ward, evermore in subjection.
Lafeu. You shall find of the king a husband, madam; you,
sir, a father: he that so generally is at all times
good must of necessity hold his virtue to you; whose
worthiness would stir it up where it wanted rather10
than lack it where there is such abundance.
Countess. What hope is there of his majesty's amendment?
Lafeu. He hath abandoned his physicians, madam; under whose
practises he hath persecuted time with hope, and
finds no other advantage in the process but only the15
losing of hope by time.
Countess. This young gentlewoman had a father,—O, that
'had'! how sad a passage 'tis!—whose skill was
almost as great as his honesty; had it stretched so
far, would have made nature immortal, and death20
should have play for lack of work. Would, for the
king's sake, he were living! I think it would be
the death of the king's disease.
Lafeu. How called you the man you speak of, madam?
Countess. He was famous, sir, in his profession, and it was25
his great right to be so: Gerard de Narbon.
Lafeu. He was excellent indeed, madam: the king very
lately spoke of him admiringly and mourningly: he
was skilful enough to have lived still, if knowledge
could be set up against mortality.30
Bertram. What is it, my good lord, the king languishes of?
Lafeu. A fistula, my lord.
Bertram. I heard not of it before.
Lafeu. I would it were not notorious. Was this gentlewoman
the daughter of Gerard de Narbon?35
Countess. His sole child, my lord, and bequeathed to my
overlooking. I have those hopes of her good that
her education promises; her dispositions she
inherits, which makes fair gifts fairer; for where
an unclean mind carries virtuous qualities, there40
commendations go with pity; they are virtues and
traitors too; in her they are the better for their
simpleness; she derives her honesty and achieves her goodness.
Lafeu. Your commendations, madam, get from her tears.
Countess. 'Tis the best brine a maiden can season her praise45
in. The remembrance of her father never approaches
her heart but the tyranny of her sorrows takes all
livelihood from her cheek. No more of this, Helena;
go to, no more; lest it be rather thought you affect
a sorrow than have it.50
Helena. I do affect a sorrow indeed, but I have it too.
Lafeu. Moderate lamentation is the right of the dead,
excessive grief the enemy to the living.
Countess. If the living be enemy to the grief, the excess
makes it soon mortal.55
Bertram. Madam, I desire your holy wishes.
Lafeu. How understand we that?
Countess. Be thou blest, Bertram, and succeed thy father
In manners, as in shape! thy blood and virtue
Contend for empire in thee, and thy goodness
Share with thy birthright! Love all, trust a few,60
Do wrong to none: be able for thine enemy
Rather in power than use, and keep thy friend
Under thy own life's key: be cheque'd for silence,
But never tax'd for speech. What heaven more will,
That thee may furnish and my prayers pluck down,65
Fall on thy head! Farewell, my lord;
'Tis an unseason'd courtier; good my lord,
Advise him.
Lafeu. He cannot want the best
That shall attend his love.
Countess. Heaven bless him! Farewell, Bertram.
[Exit]

Bertram. [To HELENA] The best wishes that can be forged in
your thoughts be servants to you! Be comfortable75
to my mother, your mistress, and make much of her.
Lafeu. Farewell, pretty lady: you must hold the credit of
your father.
[Exeunt BERTRAM and Lafeu]

Helena. O, were that all! I think not on my father;80
And these great tears grace his remembrance more
Than those I shed for him. What was he like?
I have forgot him: my imagination
Carries no favour in't but Bertram's.
I am undone: there is no living, none,85
If Bertram be away. 'Twere all one
That I should love a bright particular star
And think to wed it, he is so above me:
In his bright radiance and collateral light
Must I be comforted, not in his sphere.90
The ambition in my love thus plagues itself:
The hind that would be mated by the lion
Must die for love. 'Twas pretty, though plague,
To see him every hour; to sit and draw
His arched brows, his hawking eye, his curls,95
In our heart's table; heart too capable
Of every line and trick of his sweet favour:
But now he's gone, and my idolatrous fancy
Must sanctify his reliques. Who comes here?

Enter PAROLLES

One that goes with him: I love him for his sake;
And yet I know him a notorious liar,
Think him a great way fool, solely a coward;
Yet these fixed evils sit so fit in him
That they take place, when virtue's steely bones
Looks bleak i' the cold wind: withal, full oft we see
Cold wisdom waiting on superfluous folly.
Parolles, you were born under a charitable star.
Parolles. Under Mars, I.
Helena. I especially think under Mars.
Parolles. Why under Mars?
Helena. The wars hath so kept you under that you must needs
be born under Mars.
Parolles. When he was predominant.
Helena. When he was retrograde, I think, rather.
Parolles. Why think you so?
Helena. You go so much backward when you fight.
Parolles. That's for advantage.
Helena. So is running away, when fear proposes the safety;
but the composition that your valour and fear makes
in you is a virtue of a good wing, and I like the wear well.
Parolles. I am so full of businesses, I cannot answer
thee acutely. I will return perfect courtier;
in the which my instruction shall serve to naturalize
thee, so thou wilt be capable of a courtier's counsel
and understand what advice shall thrust upon thee;
else thou diest in thine unthankfulness, and thine
ignorance makes thee away: farewell. When thou
hast leisure, say thy prayers; when thou hast none,
remember thy friends: get thee a good husband, and
use him as he uses thee: so, farewell.
[Exit]

Helena. Our remedies oft in ourselves do lie,
Which we ascribe to heaven: the fated sky
Gives us free scope; only, doth backward pull
Our slow designs when we ourselves are dull.
What power is it which mounts my love so high,
That makes me see, and cannot feed mine eye?
The mightiest space in fortune nature brings
To join like likes and kiss like native things.
Impossible be strange attempts to those
That weigh their pains in sense, and do suppose
What hath been cannot be: who ever strove
To show her merit, that did miss her love?
The king's disease—my project may deceive me,
But my intents are fix'd and will not leave me.
[Exit]
